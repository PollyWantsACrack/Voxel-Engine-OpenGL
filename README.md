This project is my custom voxel engine created in OpenGL. All of it was created by myself without copying code. The project is made in C++ and is object oriented. I have made it so it can be easily modified by programmer
There is demo video witch can be watched to see the actual working of program.
Features:


A) Running features:
  - Building
  - Removing blocks
  - Moving around the scene along all axes with adjustable movement speed
  - Dynamic camera that can be rotated along all axes.
  - Switching between mesh mode and solid mode
  - Collision with blocks
  - Diffrent texture blocks
  - Changing block type in real time
  - jumping
  - gravity

B) Background features:
  - Optimization by not rendering blocks that are surrounded on all sides by other blocks.

C) Code features:
  - Ability to upload custom textures.
  - Generating a vertex grid based on a chosen number.
  - Classes for generating individual OpenGL elements.
  - Ability to set diffrent blocks to air before startup.
  - Easy object creation
  - Shaders in txt file that can be externally provided for shader program
